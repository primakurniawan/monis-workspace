## Workspace Designer MVP

I built an interactive workspace configurator focused on providing a playful, visual experience rather than a traditional catalog.

### Tech Stack
- Next.js (App Router)
- Tailwind CSS
- Zustand (state management)
- Framer Motion (animations)
- Deployed on Vercel

### Approach
I separated configuration logic from presentation to keep the system scalable. The workspace preview uses layered components that update in real time based on global state.

### Future Improvements
- Drag & drop positioning
- Persist configuration to URL
- Rental duration selector
- Integration with real backend pricing
